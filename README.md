## Getting Started

Welcome to the Java project! ðŸŽ‰

You've just cloned a well-organized Java application that appears to be a multiplayer zombie game. Here's a quick rundown to help you get started:

1. The project is set up for Visual Studio Code, making it easy to dive right in.
2. The main code is in the src folder. This is where you'll spend most of your time.
3. Key areas of the project include:
   - client: Handles client-server communication
   - components: Contains UI elements
   - models: Defines game objects like players and zombies
   - page: Manages different screens in the game
   - utils: Offers helpful utility functions
4. Resources like images and sounds are in the resource folder.
5. Dependencies are managed in the lib folder and through the JAVA PROJECTS view in VS Code.

To start contributing, open the project in VS Code and explore the src folder. The App.java file is likely a good starting point to understand the application's flow.
